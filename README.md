Likes Coffee
=============================
Codebase for my [statically generated blog](http://likescoffee.com/).
Uses [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) as a React framework to generate HTML from Markdown.
Uses [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for deployment and specifies the branch to push to (master).
Github user pages publish from the master branch.

Deployed to [http://pamo.github.io](http://pamo.github.io) and [http://likescoffee.com/](http://likescoffee.com)

The master branch is the generated static content, [development](https://github.com/pamo/pamo.github.io/tree/development) branch contains source codes.

To run server and develop:
```
npm start
```

To deploy:
```
npm run deploy
```

To write a new post:
```
npm run publish
```
